## Building on divanator
[feverish][] builds on divanator, providing a cli with built-in help.
See that project for an example to use divanator. You can expect that
a few features will migrate upwards from [feverish][] to this project.

## Missing features
Currently doesn't handle view/lib/ content.

We're not providing polyfills thru babel yet. So some things like
```Object.assign()``` won't work in a design document function.
